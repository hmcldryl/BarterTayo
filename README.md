# BarterTayo

**A Barter Marketplace App for Filipinos**  
_Built with Android Java + Firebase_


## 📱 Overview

**BarterTayo** is a mobile application I created during the COVID-19 pandemic when barter communities surged across the Philippines. Inspired by the need for contactless trade and the spirit of bayanihan, BarterTayo lets users post items they'd like to barter and browse what others are offering in return.

This project aimed to provide a simple, accessible way for Filipinos to connect and exchange goods — especially during a time when many were financially strained.

> 🧑‍💻 **Note:** Like my other early pandemic projects, BarterTayo was developed while I was still learning Android development. The code may not follow clean architecture or best practices, but it reflects my journey and experimentation during that time.
